			<h3>Synopsis</h3>
			<p>I've worked for the last two years as an engineering intern at American Precision Avionics in Duluth MN, working with their fantastic engineering team to produce the very high quality wiring harnesses for use in aviation and industrial equipment. Here, I learned about technical documentation, CAD, and industry quality standards. I also found an interest in computer networks, 3D printing, and creating desktop applications while I've invented methods and devices to help both the engineering and production teams.</p>
			<p>When I'm not working or studying, I like to pass my time working on digital circuits and software. I'm especially interested in vehicle electronics; While on the road, I've kept myself occupied by troubleshooting the systems on my motorcycle (from 1982!) and continuing my software experiments on my laptop.</p>
			<p>I've also worked with the IEEE Arrowhead Chapter as President of the UMD IEEE Club. As a club we've organized events to enrich and supplement students' learning, including company tours, workshops, and offering tools for students to investigate EE and find their place in this wonderful profession.</p>

			<p>I would like to work on a team to develop new devices and methods to solve the problems at the horizon of our industry.
			<br>My mission is less specific to any certain technology, instead I hope to apply my philosophy toward technology in whatever form my job takes. There is more richness to me in solving challenging problems than working on any particular project. I wish to find purpose and meaning in my work, as I think that my career is how I'll make an impact in the world.</p>

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p id="seniord"><b>Senior Design Project:</b> Long-Range ISM-Band File Transfer
			<br>This is a system of devices and an accompanying protocol for transferring files up to a kilometer away. My teammates and I developed this novel implementation of a common idea using several popular technologies including: Python, Raspberry Pi, LoRa, CAD, and FDM.

			</p>
			<p><b>Reverser Engineering Duluth Maker Space CNC</b>
			<br>The Duluth Maker space had recently installed a new CNC router in their wood-shop. In order to operate it however, they needed an electrical schematic for the city to approve. I was referred to this task by my friend Josh from APA.
			<br>See below for the final product, made in Libre Office. I had a lot of fun working with the DMS staff on this!
			<br><a href="./dms_masso.pdf">Electrical Schematic</a>
			</p>
			<p><b>UMD EE Lounge Workspace</b>
			<br>One of the most common grievances from EE undergrads at UMD is the lack of resources available to student for personal projects. This follows from the second most common comment: that there is a lack of hands on teaching in the curriculum.
			<br>To help with this, I converted one of the UMD student areas to a workspace. This includes a workbench with tools for creating electronics, including a 3D printer. 
			</p>
			<p><b>Tesla Coil Interactive Display</b>
			<br>The EE Lounge is where I spent much of my time between classes, so I made an effort to make it into an inviting place for learning and collaboration. There is a display case next to the entrance, which initially contained a monitor that had long-since stopped working. I took an abandoned Tesla Coil that was once a capstone project and replaced the monitor with it. I then built a Faraday Cage around the coil for safety, then added some buttons so that visitors can energize the coil themselves!
