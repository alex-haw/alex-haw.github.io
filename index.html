			<h3>Objective</h3>
			<p>I like to pass my time working on digital circuits and software. I'm especially interested in vehicle electronics; While on the road, I've kept myself occupied by troubleshooting the systems on my motorcyle (from 1982!).</p>
			<p>I would like to work on a team to develop new devices and methods to solve the problems at the horizon of our industry.</p>
			<p>My mission is less specific to any certain technology, instead I hope to apply my philosophy toward technology in whatever form my job takes. There is more richness to me in solving challenging problems than working on any particular project. I wish to find purpose and meaning in my work, since I think that my career is how I'll make an impact in the world.</p>
